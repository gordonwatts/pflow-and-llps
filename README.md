# pflow-and-llps

Study the interaction between PFLOW jets and LLPs

## Running on the Chicago AF

Make sure to use the `conda` environment. This is only important if you are running remotely via `vscode` - if you use the primary jupyter interface it will automatically select this.

You'll have to `pip install -r requirements.txt` to add extra modules to the environment.

## Layout

* scratch - simple throw away code and notebooks for examples, trying stuff out, etc.
* studies - Put the actual study notebooks here for "presentation", etc.
